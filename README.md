# Java-Basics
Hello Myself Uday Singh, so I will be helping you with the java basics.
So for the demo I have uploaded the simple calculator program.
It invloves maximum basic concepts of java programming such as Inheritance, Threading, Synchronization, Enumeration, Interface, method overloading and overriding, Abstract class and abstract methods, Packages, and menu driven functionality.
Actually the Interface.java file should be placed in the other package and the calculator.java file should be placed in the main package for the Packages concept.
